Highlights strengths and weakesses related to designing software for clients


    Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? 

In summary, the Gaming Room client wanted an application to be developed that would be cross-platform. This application would be a step up from what they had, which was the game made solely for android systems.  

 

    What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation? 

I think I did a solid job of documenting the constraints and requirements that the client wanted. A stronger understanding of what the client will ensure the client is happy and the team is executing on the things that need to be done.  

 

    What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code? 

I found it helpful to stop thinking about any bias that I may have for a particular operating system and only focus on the srengths and weaknesses of each operating system. Doing this led me to new discoveries relating to operating systems.  

 

    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 

I think if I could go back, I would revise all my work on Windows and further document its weaknesses. Bias leads to sticking points and slowed growth. 

 

    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 

I interpreted the user’s needs by putting myself in their shoes and thinking of the things that I may want to have in an application. I implemented these needs by recommending an operating system that had great tools for designing these types of applications. Of course, though, Windows development has its weaknesses just as the others do. It is important to consider the user’s needs because if the user does not like the application, then there will be nobody to play the game, rendering the project useless. 

 

    How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application? 

I find it easiest to map out the things I am required to do and lay out the boundaries for the project. Developing is a lot easier when everything is all laid out and ready to be worked on, rather than making the steps up as you go. This is a technique that I would find useful in the future when developing a project like this.
